# SKR_Physics
SKR_Physics is a lightweight and easy to use 2D physics engine which is written in C.

# Features
It has a rectangle based collision detection system which is almost perfect.

You can create a world with gravity and air friction. You can create static, kinematic and dynamic objects inside this world. (If you aren't familiar with these terms, check the header file of the library.) 

You can simulate the world for the time you set.

It has no dependency.

Unfortunately, there are only dynamic-static and dynamic-kinematic interactions for now. I am still thinking to how to resolve dynamic-dynamic interactions. I will update the library as I solve problems like this. 

# How to use it
You should examine the header file and the examples to learn how to use it. The example is a SDL implementation of this library. Also there are demos in the files, you can download and quickly check if the engine works well.

# License
